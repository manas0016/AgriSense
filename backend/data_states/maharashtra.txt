Maharashtra Mahatma Jyotirao Phule Shetkari Loan Waiver Scheme Apply Offline
Maharashtra govt. has announced a loan waiver of upto Rs. 2 lakh for farmers with cut off date of 30 September 2019. The Mahatma Jyotirao Phule Farmer Loan Waiver Scheme of the newly formed Shiv Sena, NCP & Congress coalition regime comes over two years after the Rs. 34,000 crore loan waiver announced by the then BJP-Sena government. Previously, the state govt. had launched the Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj Shetkari Samman Yojana (छत्रपती शिवाजी महाराज शेतकरी सन्मान सन २०१७ कर्जमाफी वितरण योजना) in 2017. 
CM Uddhav Thackeray has made this announcement in the legislative assembly on the last day of winter session of legislature. However, there was no word on how much financial burden the new Farm Loan Waiver Scheme in Maharashtra would put on the state treasury. Mahatma Jyotiba Phule Loan Waiver Scheme would require minimum documentation and would be hassle free.
Member of Parliament (MP), state legislators and government employees will not receive the benefit of Maharashtra Mahatma Jyotiba Phule Shetkari Karj Mukti Yojana. The new Kisan Karz Mafi Yojana will cover farmers who cultivate fruit trees and sugarcane as well as conventional crops.

Maharashtra Mahatma Jyotiba Phule Loan Waiver Scheme Application Process
The state govt. will make a film for farmers to better understand the application procedure for Mahatma Jyotiba Phule Farm Loan Waiver Scheme. No person will have to stand in long queues unlike previous CSMSSY loan waiver scheme. All the farmers who wish to avail benefits of crop loan waiver scheme will need to approach their bank only with Aadhaar card.
Upon reaching the banks, Bank officials will take the person’s thumb print and the government will transfer the amount to the loan account of the farmer. In addition to this, it is important to note that no online form submission will be needed for Mahatma Jyotirao Phule Farm Loan Waiver Scheme 2020-21. Applicants will have to follow the offline application process to get their name enrolled in Mahatma Jyotiba Phule Shetkari karj Mukti Yojana list of beneficiaries.
Opposition of Maharashtra Jyotirao Phule Shetkari Karj Mukti Yojana
Former CM and current leader of opposition, Devendra Fadnavis alleged that the government had not fulfilled its original promise of full loan waiver. He questioned the govt’s failure to provide financial assistance of Rs. 25,000 per hectare to farmers who suffered losses due to unseasonal rain.
Fadnavis and other BJP MLAs then staged a walk out in protest of Mahatma Jyotirao Phule Farm Loan Waiver Scheme. Moreover, Devendra Fadnavis also alleged that the scheme will benefit very few farmers as most of them were already covered by his government’s CSMSSY 2017 scheme. He said that the govt. is cheating farmers as it is not offering full loan waiver.

Maharashtra government is going to change the eligibility criteria to “One Family One House” for beneficiaries in government housing schemes. This rule is being changed as an aftermath of the Bombay High Court order. Now under One Family One House Scheme, a person will not be eligible to get a flat in a government scheme if he or his immediate family has previously been allotted a flat anywhere in Maharashtra.
In the FY 2018, Bombay High Court was hearing a plea that no other house will be allotted to a beneficiary if he has already 1 under govt. housing scheme. In this One Family One House scheme, a person and immediate family will only have 1 house anywhere in the state.
This rule will even apply in case the beneficiary is a judge or a bureaucrat. The challenge in HC was to an allotment made to a society of sitting HC judges in the suburbs of Mumbai.

Maharashtra One Family One House Scheme 2019
As per the existing policy, there are restrictions only on a second home in a government scheme in the same district. Several politicians and bureaucrats are taking benefits of this provision on multiple occasions. So, the housing department has made a new policy of One Family One House Scheme 2019. 
This new scheme will soon be tabled before the cabinet committee of Maharashtra in next few weeks. This policy of One Person One Home in govt. housing schemes is expected to get cabinet approval. The state govt. has already committed to unveil the policy to the Bombay high court. 


(adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});

This norm will remain applicable to the beneficiary immediate family such as wife or dependent child to ensure that ineligible beneficiary does not get second house in name of family member. It is still not known that whether norm is applicable for free-housing rehabilitation schemes or not. 
The state govt. is seeking advice of law department on whether norm should also apply to rehabilitation schemes. In this schemes, govt. provides buildable area incentives in lieu of free rehabilitation of occupiers.

City and Industrial Development Corporation Maharashtra has planned to provide 90,000 homes under its mega CIDCO Lucky Draw Housing Scheme in Navi Mumbai. This CIDCO lucky draw 2019 would be a part of the Prime Minister’s flagship “Housing For All (HFA) by 2022” scheme. All the affordable houses would be sold through lottery by July end or August 2019.
All the flats under CIDCO Maharashtra Lucky Draw Housing Scheme 2019 are meant for economically weaker sections (EWS) and low-income groups (LIG). These new houses would be constructed under the Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana (PMAY) housing scheme.
CIDCO has all the permission in place and till the June end, the tender for construction of 90,000 flats would be opened by July or August. All of these newly constructed houses would be put up for sale through a lottery.

CIDCO Maharashtra Lucky Draw Housing Scheme 2019
CIDCO Maharashtra will provide around 90,000 affordable houses under this new Lucky Draw Housing Scheme 2019. The prices of these houses would be 20% to 30% cheaper than those offered by private developers in the open market. Moreover, buyers will get more flexibility in making payment and all the lottery winners can pay for homes as the construction progresses. Just like the previous CIDCO scheme for 14,000 homes, this scheme will also remain hit.
CIDCO Lucky Draw 2019 Scheme has caused a stir in the Mumbai’s real estate market. There is already a demand of 2 lakh homes and supply is almost nil. But the quality and location of CIDCO houses is not as desirable as those homes offered by private developers. Private developer choose sites close to railway stations, markets, schools and thus asks for higher premium amount.


(adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});

However, the new CIDCO Maharashtra housing scheme is going to boost development of local infrastructure. Moreover, the CIDCO’s affordable housing scheme will help buyers who cannot afford a private project. As the houses offered by either CIDCO or MHADA are affordable, so every year there are so many applicants for housing lotteries. It is expected that the project would bring much needed correction in an overpriced market.
All the houses provided by CIDCO are cheaper and comes at reasonable rates. In addition to this, there is no cheating, fraud or delay in the housing projects. A buyer feels more confident in buying a government-developed house. In the area, government rates range in the Rs. 4,500 to 5,000 per sq.ft bracket. This ready reckoner rate varies from area to area. CIDCO is selling houses at Rs 6,000 per sq.ft as compared to Rs. 9,000 per sq.ft price of a private developer.

Maharashtra Skimmed Milk Powder for Class 1st to 8th Students
All the students studying in Class 1st to 8th and their parents would get 3 packets of Skimmed Milk Powder totalling to 600 gm for 3 months. Parents needs to reconstitute milk from the given powder and must feed it to their school going children. 200 gm milk powder every month will account to 2 to 3 teaspoons of powder for milk everyday. 
This pilot project for Skimmed Milk to Primary School Students will be launched in all schools. However, this scheme will exclude schools under Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation limits as these schools possess central govt.-promoted school nutrition programme is already existing. 


(adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});

Other political parties are consistently opposing this move as 200 gm packet may not be sufficient for the entire month. In case the child needs to have a glass of milk for 2 times in a day, then this amount of skimmed milk powder will be insufficient. Reports of Economic Survey 2017-18 (Page 177) of Maharashtra suggests that there are 1,06,527 primary schools (Std I to Std VIII) with total student enrollment of 15,909. Out of these students, around 7,450 students are girls.
Maharashtra School Nutrition Scheme for Primary Students
Schools will distribute skimmed milk powder packets to primary school students in presence of School Management Committee. At distribution event, schools will also tell the parents about how to reconstitute milk from that milk powder. Govt. will also ensure that schools will only distribute milk powder produced in the state itself.
The state govt. has decided to implement this School Nutrition Scheme on a pilot basis for 3 months. This year, milk is produced in surplus quantities in the state of Maharashtra. So, the govt. has made an announcement that on 10 July 2018, milk or milk powder will be given as a supplement to the School Nutrition Scheme.
Govt. has studied Ksheera Bahgya Yojana implemented by the Karnataka government. A committee headed by the additional chief secretary of the school education department will monitor the implementation of this Skimmed Milk Powder Scheme for Class 1st to 8th Students. Education director of primary education will be the coordinating officer for this pilot project.

India’s First Plastic Buyback Scheme for PET Bottles & Milk PouchesPlastic Ban in Maharashtra – BackgroundDairy Issues in Implementation of Plastic Buyback Scheme
Maharashtra govt. is going to implement India’s First Plastic Buyback Scheme. Under this scheme, customers will get money from the retailers on handling PET bottles and Milk Pouches back to the store to ensure recycling of Plastic waste. Previously, govt. has imposed complete ban (with certain exemptions) on the manufacture, usage, sale, transport, handling and storage of plastic across the state.
The state govt. will also introduce a similar mechanism for tetra packs and retail packaging in the next 3 months. This buyback depository scheme is already existing in 40 countries across the world. This scheme will be helpful in reducing generation of plastic waste across the state.
Under Maharashtra Plastic & Thermocol Products Notification 2018, it is compulsory for manufacturers to take full responsibility for collection & recycling infrastructure for plastic.

India’s First Plastic Buyback Scheme for PET Bottles & Milk Pouches
Under this scheme, manufacturers have the responsibility to recycle PET bottles and milk pouches. Moreover, they will have to levy a refundable charge to ensure that the buyers return all plastic bottles / pouches to the stores or at collection machines. But, manufactures have still not submitted their plans on how to implement this scheme. The scheme has high deposit rates, shortage of recycling capacity and lack of incentives for recyclers which is a major challenge.
Maharashtra Plastic Buyback Scheme
Recycling Mechanism is a condition to obtain licence which manufacturers are not implementing strictly. All those manufacturers who violates this condition will have to face consequences. State govt. has fixed Rs. 50 paise as a refundable deposit for milk pouches and Rs. 1-2 for PET bottles.

Plastic Ban in Maharashtra – Background
Maharashtra govt. has imposed a ban on the plastic across the state. All the products which are banned or not are shown in the image below:-
Maharashtra Plastic Products Ban
The state govt. exempted PET bottles of 200 ml and more capacity and milk pouches from the near-all plastic ban after manufacturers agreed to take responsibility for disposal of plastic waste.
Dairy Issues in Implementation of Plastic Buyback Scheme
A 500 ml bottle costs 60 paise and the recycler has to refund Rs. 2 to consumers. There is an assumption that people would start manufacturing empty PET bottles and dump them in these machines. This would give them a profit of Rs. 1.40 per bottle.
Plastic Buyback Scheme Dairies Issues
This policy is continuously being revised. Govt. is inviting suggestions from all stakeholders. This scheme will be effectively implemented when recycler also generates profits.

Maharashtra government will launch a New Policy for Affordable Housing under the Public Private Partnership (PPP) model. Under this new PPP Policy, the state govt. will become authorized to acquire land parcels in the Mumbai Metropolitan Region from the private land owners to complete their affordable housing projects under Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana (PMAY). 
The primary objective to launch this policy is to give a boost to the housing sector in the Mumbai Metropolitan Region (MMR). Govt. is working consistently towards the fulfillment of construction works of 20 lakh houses in the states till FY 2020. Out of these total number of houses, 5 lakh houses are in Mumbai while there are around 10 lakh houses in MMR. 
The state govt. will acquire the lands in MMR which includes the state’s capital Mumbai and its satellite towns. The officials will table this new PPP Policy before the cabinet in the next 8 to 10 days.



(adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});

Maharashtra New Policy for Housing – PPP Model
The draft of the new PPP Policy for MMR comprises of 2 most important features as described below:-

All the land owners who possess a land holding of more than 100 acres and are unable to develop a big project will have to either sell their land to the govt. or partner with the govt. to develop that land.
In case the state govt. acquires the land, then the land owners will get compensation from the govt. as per the existing reckoner rate or can get homes by the state govt.

The state govt. feels the need for this new policy as there are various large land parcels with an area upto 100 to 500 acres in the MMR region where owners does not have finances to develop their land. Moreover, if these owners develop their land into big projects, they can just get an FSI of 1 or at-most 2.5. On these FSI, they also have to pay premium. 


(adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});

So, govt. is going to bing this new PPP Policy to benefit the owners as well as to provide affordable housing to the poor people. Maharashtra Housing and Area Development Authority is now selected as the single nodal agency to monitor the affordable housing under Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana.

Maharashtra govt. has approved a new High Voltage Distribution System Scheme to provide electricity connection to farmers. This HVDS Scheme will ensure proper power supply to farmers for efficient utilization of agricultural pumps. This govt. scheme will benefit around 2.24 lakh farmers in the state who are still waiting for new power connections.
Mahavitaran – State power distribution utility is going to take a loan of Rs. 2500 crore for HVDS Scheme. Maharashtra govt. will be the guarantor for this loan amount. Now farmers will get high voltage electricity without tripping effects. To reduce electricity losses, govt. will launch “One Farmer One Transformer” Scheme.
At present, Maharashtra govt. provides eight hours electricity supply to farmers on a daily basis. For this, there are approx. 700 feeders. But now, the state govt. has decided to launch High voltage distribution scheme to provide more electricity to farmers. HVDS Scheme will cost Rs. 5048 crore to the state exchequor. 



(adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});

High Voltage Distribution System – HVDS Scheme
Till date, villages and farms share a common electricity connection for agriculture purposes which does not ensure adequate power supply to farmers. Maharashtra govt. is going to launch One Farmer One Transformer Scheme to provide separate electricity connections for villages and farms. For now, govt. has launched HVDS Scheme whose details are as follows:-

Govt. has approved High Voltage Distribution System (HVDS) Scheme to provide electricity connections and to ensure proper power supply to farmers for agriculture.
Now every 2 farmers will share a single transformers through HVDS lines under this scheme.
This scheme will reduce the line losses from 50% to 15% in some places.
Maharashtra govt. will launch this scheme on 15 August 2018 and on the same day, govt. will start providing transformers upto 31 March next year.
In the current scenario, around 10 to 15 farmers receive electricity through 65 to 100 Kilovolt-Ampere (kVA) lines. This leads to low voltage electricity and power tripping due to defects in transformers.
The state govt. has made budgetary allocation of Rs. 600 crore for Marathwada and Vidarbha Regions. Moreover, Maharavitran will also avail loan of Rs. 2500 crore for which state govt. will act as guarantor.
Under HVDS Scheme, the total expenditure for a single agricultural pump is expected to be approx. 2 lakh.

In the past few years, Maharashtra has become self sufficient in electricity and there is no power shortage. Govt. has already achieved 23,100 MW electricity production capacity to provide uninterrupted power supply. With this capacity, there are no complaints on load-shedding for industrialm residential and commercial customers.


(adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});

As on 1 April 2018, there are around 45 lakh farmers who have not paid their electricity bills worth Rs. 13,198 crore. So, the state govt. wants them to pay at least Rs 5,000 each to be able to strengthen the transmission system. Even the state govt. has stopped disconnecting electricity connections for the bill defaulters.
As a pro-farmer govt., around 4 lakh farmers have already received agricultural pumps connections in the previous 3 years. Each agricultural connection costs around Rs. 1.5 lakh. So, the state govt. is making all possible efforts to raise the standards of living of poor farmers.

Initially, the solar power will be distributed to only dedicated feeders. Currently, the government is implementing solar power generation projects in Solapur and Latur on Public Private Partnership basis.
