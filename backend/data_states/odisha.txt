Central govt. has launched the Ujjwala Sanitary Napkins Initiative for women in Odisha. Under this scheme, all the women will get access to hygiene products along with employment opportunities in every district of the state. This scheme of Union govt. will be a counter of the state-run Khushi Scheme in which govt. provides free sanitary napkins to female students of govt. and govt. aided schools in the state. 
In 1st phase of Ujjwala Sanitary Napkin Initiative, oil marketing companies will setup around 100 local manufacturing units. OMCs will setup these units at common service centers (CSCs) across 93 blocks in 30 districts in Odisha. Common Service Centres (CSCs) are facilities which are set up to deliver govt. e-services in rural and remote locations.
As per the National Family Health Survey (NFHS) report, the overall usage of sanitary napkins in Odisha is 33.5% which is quite low. So, central govt. wants to make usage of sanitary napkins into a mass movement.

Ujjwala Sanitary Napkins Initiative by Central Govt.
The central govt. has started Ujjwala Sanitary Napkin Initiative to promote hygiene and providing job opportunities to women. Each manufacturing unit would be setup at an approx. cost of Rs. 2.94 crore. Each pack will comprise of 8 sanitary pads for which the cost is Rs. 42 per pack. Moreover, each manufacturing unit will employ 5 or 6 Ujjwala beneficiaries. So, this initiative will provide employment to nearly 600 women across all the districts.
All the women will first receive training in manufacturing and sale of sanitary napkins. This initiative will provide opportunities to women to earn between Rs. 5,000 and Rs. 15,000 per month. This scheme is going to make women self reliant as the previous measures of distributing money to women through revolving funds is insufficient.

Ujjwala Sanitary Napkins Initiative will raise the overall usage of sanitary napkins in women and will promote women hygiene. This initiative will provide an opportunity to all the ujjwala beneficiaries to earn in poor and rural areas. Now such ujjwala scheme beneficiaries can earn in the hours saved from no longer having to cook on firewood.

Scheme for UPSC Civil Service Coaching Odisha – Background
For a long time, there was an urgent need for a state sponsored Centre for Administrative and Academic Career development for youth from Odisha. These youths includes all the students who completed their graduation and post graduation degree from universities and are looking for a career in administrative jobs in civil services, banks, insurance sectors or in private sectors. But the success rate of graduates from Odisha universities in national level competitive examinations without any preparatory training was lower.
So, the students had to travel to Delhi to prepare for Civil Service examinations. In Delhi, students get access to quality library and private coaching centres having good and dedicated teachers. For poor but talented students of Odisha, getting training in New Delhi by spending huge amount of fees and living expenses is difficult. So, the state govt. tries to tackle this problem by funding high quality training centres in universities.
Though these centres will take some time to stabilize, so govt. felt an urgent need of selection of coaching centre which can impart quality training in a focusses manner. Moreover, the coaching center must have credential of imparting effective coaching for UPSC civil service exam and whose success rate must also be high. So, DHE Odisha has selected M/s Dhyeya IAS, New Delhi after following a transparent tender process. The coaching center has been established in Bhubaneswar in order to ensure that Odia students gets coaching opportunity in their home State.

This scheme will help the development authority to raise the revenue and will be a major solution to the land deals.
Odisha govt. has first launched this scheme as per the BDA Planning and Building Standard Regulation, 2001 but was dropped in FY 2008. Now, govt. is going to re-launch this amnesty scheme. Residents have already regularize their constructions where deviation was less than 10% but this limit is now increased to 50% in renewed scheme. Previously, BDA collected compounding fees at Rs. 25 / sq. ft. Govt. will now calculate this fees as per the benchmark price fixed by the government.

Odisha govt. is going to introduce its new Food Security Scheme 2018 in the state. This scheme will cover an additional 34.44 lakh people who are previously left out from the National Food Security Act (NFSA) 2013. The state govt. will start implementing this scheme from 2 October 2018 (Gandhi Jayanti).
After the implementation of Food Security Scheme, not a single poor person would be left out and deprived of their rights of food security. NFSA is being implemented on the basis of 2011 Census and total number of beneficiaries is increased in the recent years.
Previously, CM has taken up this matter with the PM Narendra Modi but this issue was not addressed and no further steps were taken to resolve this issue. So, govt. is now going to implement its own Food Security Scheme.

Odisha Food Security Scheme 2018
Central govt. is implementing National Food Security Act (NFSA) as per the Socio-Economic Caste Census (SECC-2011) Data. A large number of poor people whose name does not appears in SECC-2011 Data are deprived of the food security benefits. Accordingly, the state govt. has decided to roll-out its own Food Security Scheme 2018 for all those whose name is not present in the NFSA beneficiary list. 
As per the official data, there are more than 34 lakh beneficiaries who are not included in NFSA. For these, govt. will implement new Food Security Act from 2 October 2018. CM has made this announcement while addressing a video conference under ‘Ama Mukhyamantri, Ama Katha’ program held on 28 July 2018.

Odisha state government is giving importance to food security. The state govt. is providing Rice at Rs. 2 per kg since 2008. The successful implementation of this prompts govt. to provide Rice at Rs. 1 to poor families. So, govt. is providing rice at Rs. 1 per kg after 2013. It has been a milestone in food security in the entire country.
Need for Odisha Food Security Act, 2018
The total population of state is around 4.19 crore. Odisha govt. is implementing NFSA from November 2015. Out of total population, around 3.26 crore people (78% of total population) are already covered under NFSA. Now the state govt. wants to tweak Odisha Food Security Rules 2017 to add 34.44 lakh more beneficiaries. 
There are provisions in the rules which empowers the state govt. to expand the scope of coverage. Odisha govt. aims to cover 3.6 crore beneficiaries under the NFSA.

Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana – Gramin (PMAY-G) has finally been launched by the Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi in Agra on 20th November 2016. Under the PM Awas Yojana Gramin affordable housing scheme, central government aims to develop 3 Crore homes by the year 2022 in rural areas for poor families including BPL.
PMAY-G is the revamped version of Indira Awas Yojana which was renamed earlier this year with some pro-poor changes in the scheme. Housing units under the PMAY-G scheme are already being offered to the beneficiaries in rural areas across the country. Pradhan Mantri Narendra Modi also handed over the allotment letters to the beneficiaries during the launch event.
The minimum area of home under the new scheme has been increased to 25 Square meter (267 Square foot) from 20 Sq.Mt. in earlier scheme.
