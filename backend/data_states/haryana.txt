Haryana government is going to start a new Parali Incentive Scheme 2019. In this scheme, the state govt. will provide support of Rs 100/quintal to small and marginal farmers who have not burned stubble in their fields. This amount would only be applicable to non Basmati paddy procured by government. Stubble incentives would be provided through deputy commissioner.
The number of Haryana Parali Incentive Scheme beneficiaries and estimated cost will be known after CM’s clearance. As per an estimate, around 20 lakh farmers in Haryana cultivate on less than 5 acres of land. The government has information of land and bank accounts of all the farmers. The proposal to curb stubble burning is sent to CM Manohar Lal Khattar who will take final decision in this regard.
Supreme Court has lashed out at authorities for failing to curb severe air pollution in the Delhi-NCR region. SC had directed the governments of Punjab, Haryana and Uttar Pradesh to provide support of Rs 100/quintal within seven days to farmers for not burning stubble.

Haryana Parali Incentive Scheme to Curb Stubble Burning
Parali (Stubble) burning has become a major cause of pollution in recent days. Many farmers in Haryana and Punjab burns their stubble in order to get their farm land ready for next season cultivation. The smoke emission from parali burning contains pollutants and is choking nearby state Delhi. The NCT of Delhi is just like gas chamber these days due to harmful levels of Air Quality Index (AQI). 
PM 2.5 & PM 10 levels in national capital are beyond hazardous level due to parali burning. SC has already put a ban on burning of stubble in these 2 states, but the no. of incidents of stubble burning are not reducing. This is because farmers are poor in both Haryana and Punjab states. 


(adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});

The parali machine price is not affordable as it costs around 15 lakh per machine even after getting subsidy from central govt. Moreover, the rent of parali machine is too high for farmers which they cannot afford. So to reduce the level of pollution in Delhi, Supreme Court has ordered Punjab and Haryana state govt’s to provide incentives to farmers.

Haryana government has announced Surcharge Waiver Scheme for electricity bills of tubewells on 3 September 2019. In addition to this, the state govt. also announced to provide relief of 9% to 45% to plot holders of Haryana Shehri Vikas Pradhikaran (HSVP) under the Enhancement Recalculation Scheme. This is the next major move after 3 settlement schemes for loanee farmers of cooperative banks.
The state govt. decided to provide relief to tubewell consumers having electricity connections under Surcharge Waiver Scheme & plot holders of HSVP. There are around 6.10 lakh farmers in the Haryana state which have taken electricity connections for the tubewells. 
Out of these farmers, around 2.44 lakh connections have become defaulters and an amount of Rs. 147 crore is outstanding towards them.

Haryana Surcharge Waiver on Tubewells Electricity Bills
In this new Tubewell Surcharge Waiver Scheme in Haryana, if farmers wants to pay their electricity bills then no surcharge amount would be deducted. Previously, farmers had to pay surcharge amount of 20% to 25% of the power bills of tubewells. The surcharge amount would now be waived in case farmers make lump-sum payment of their bils upto 30 November 2019.
Moreover, Tubewells electricity connections of farmers which have been discontinued for less than 2 years on becoming defaulters would be restored. On Enhancement Recalculation Scheme, CM said that earlier plot holders does not gets information on enhancement by HSVP. Due to this, interest on the enhancement amount gets increased.


(adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});

Previously in July 2018, a 1 time settlement plan with 40% rebate was launched for HSVP plot holders. Under that settlement plan, over 24,000 plot holders deposited around Rs. 853 crore as enhancement amount. In November 2019, another settlement scheme was launched with 37.5% rebate. In that scheme, over 4,000 plot holders paid an enhancement of Rs. 155 crore.
But till date, some plot holders have not paid their enhancement amount even in the previous 2 settlement schemes. The major demand of such plot holders was that the recalculation of enhancement must be done in their sectors. So, the state govt. has made new rules and a separate committee was constituted for recalculation. 
As per the recommendations of this committee, govt. has to perform recalculation of 300 sectors out of which calculation of 12 sectors has already been done. Now all the plot holders are required to deposit the enhancement amount as per this recalculation. As per the new rules, recalculation of each sector is going to be different. So, the plot holders are expected to get benefit ranging from 9% to 45%.

For the first time in the state, all the 4 power companies have emerged from losses and have earned profit. In 2017-18, UHBVN earns a profit of Rs. 278 crore and DHBVN earns profit of Rs. 134 crore. Thus the total earned profits of these 2 companies is Rs. 412 crore. To ensure welfare of farmers, the power tariff has been reduced to almost half (50%). This reduction has considerably resulted in reducing the electricity bills of domestic consumers.

Haryana state government is going to launch Bhavantar Bharpai Yojana for farmers to cover the price deficit of crops. Subsequently, this scheme will ensure that the base price (minimum support price) is fixed for vegetables. Accordingly, govt. will provide compensation (bharpai) to the farmers if they sell their vegetables below the fixed base price. Haryana govt. start implementing this government scheme from 1 January 2018. 
In the initial phase, govt. is going to fix minimum support price for 4 crops – Potato, Onion, Tomato, Cauliflower. The primary objective of this scheme is to ensure that the farmers must not face the distress sale of their produce. Moreover, govt. will fix the base price equivalent to the cultivation cost.
Latest Update – Haryana govt. has decided to provide compensation to farmers in case price of tomato falls below Rs. 4 and price of onion falls below Rs. 5 during the Kharif season. Accordingly, MSP for Tomato is fixed at Rs. 4 and for Onion is Rs. 5. Moreover, govt. will also cover two other horticulture crops – potato and cauliflower during rabi season. Henceforth, the state govt. will authenticate the cultivable area under these crops from 15 February 2018.

(adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});


Haryana govt. will launch this scheme to ensure that the farmers must get fair price for their vegetables produce.
For this reason, govt. will fix the base price equivalent to the cultivation cost.
Moreover, the state govt. emphasizes on diversification of crops. In addition to this, farmers will get access to the Delhi and National Capital Region (NCR) markets to sell their fruits, vegetables and flowers.
Govt. is also planning to adopt peri-urban agriculture for farming purposes.
This type of farming will enable the farmers to earn more money as compared to the traditional farming.
Accordingly, farmers will not have to sell their products at a lower price than the minimum support price. If they have to, then govt. will provide compensation (bharpai) equivalent to the deficit (antar) in the price (bhav).
Furthermore, farmers should produce need based crops in adjoining areas as the agricultural products are likely to decay in a short span of time.

Bhavantar Bharpai Yojana Online Application Procedure
To avail the benefits of this scheme, farmers will have to make registration on the Farmer Facility Portal. The complete procedure to apply online has been specified below:-

Firstly visit the official website agriharyana.in

Haryana govt. will lay special emphasis to bring 25% of total cultivable area under horticulture. For this reason, state govt. will setup an International Vegetable and Fruit market having an area of around 500 acres at Gannaur, Sonepat. In addition to this, govt. will also start a flower market at Gurugram to boost horticulture farming.
Under the Isro-Israel project, state govt. has established Center of Excellence for various fruits and vegetables. Moreover, govt. will soon start other similar projects to raise the milk production.

To reduce water consumption and its wastage, the state govt. of Haryana is going to start a new scheme.
Under this new scheme, all the farmers would be encouraged to produce other crops namely maize (makka), arhar (pulses) instead of cultivation of rice (dhaan). In the first phase, the scheme would be implemented in 1 part of 7 major rice producing districts. In this pariyojana, around 50,000 hectares of land would be cultivated with crops like makka, arhar & others instead of rice.

Haryana govt. has launched Mukhyamantri Kisan Khet Sadak Marg Yojana to strengthen all small passage in villages. Under this scheme, all the roads would be made of Khadanja in the next 5 years in a phased manner. Farmers land will be inter-connected with the rural and urban areas which will provide them a market to sell their agriculture produce.
CM has also announced that the registration of cultivable land of the farmers, giving details of crop sown and area under cultivation would be done twice in a single year. This 2 times registration process for cultivable land is going to assist the farmers from sowing of their crop till the sale of their agricultural produce in the market.
This is a major decision to realize the PM Modi’s vision of “Doubling Farmers Income by 2022”.

Mukhya Mantri Kisan Khet Sadak Marg Yojana
Haryana CM has announced this scheme to strengthen the roads for rural inter connectivity. Rural Development Department would carry out the work under the Mukhya Mantri Kisan Khet Sadak Marg Yojana. Under the 1st phase of the scheme, 25 kilometers passage of 3 and 4 karam in villages from each constituency would be carried out. All the roads are going to be made from Khadanja in the upcoming 5 years in a phase wise manner. 
The state govt. has also decided to perform the registration of farmer’s cultivable land twice in 1 year. The farmers could give details like name of crop sown and area under cultivation at the common service centers (CSCs) established at the village level. This scheme would help farmers in procurement, compensation, insurance and bank loans. Department of Agriculture and Farmer’s Welfare would check the registration of land and village patvari would verify it. 


(adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});

— CMO Haryana (@cmohry) December 11, 2018

Govt. will also prepare a mechanism of financial management for farmers such that they can utilize funds for enhancing productivity. Agriculture is a business so there must be a system of direct marketing to minimize the expenditure of farmers and enhancing their income. There is also a need to encourage farmers to shift from traditional farming to vegetable, fruits, flower and medicinal plants.
The state govt. will also provide special focus on the concept of peri-urban farming for around 4 crore population of Delhi and nearby areas like Faridabad, Noida, Gurugram. This includes supply of essential commodities like milk, fruits, flowers and eggs to raise income of farmers.
The state govt. has taken various initiatives like Agri Leadership Summit, Cattle fairs, Kisan Ratan Awards which have not been taken earlier. The state govt. is making consistent efforts to double the income of the farmers, reducing the cost of production and use of bio-fertilizers.

In a bid to give consumers an opportunity to come clean on electricity theft, Haryana government has launched Bijli Bill Jurmana Maafi Yojana or Voluntary Disclosure Scheme (VDS) 2016. 
Under the scheme, all categories of consumers having sanctioned load up to five KW can declare tampered or defective meters. While launching the scheme, which was launched on November 20, Haryana Chief Minister Manohar Lal Khattar said that the scheme will remain in operation until December 31, 2016. 
Highlights of Bijli Bill Jurmana Maafi Yojana
It has been decided that the cases of consumers who will voluntarily declare tampering of meter/ defective meter would not have to pay twice the tariff along with compounding charges but will be charged on nominal consumption bases sanctioned load for the last year and that too on current normal tariff only. 



(adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});

The consumer will have two options to the computed bill. The first option will be to deposit the lump-sum amount within 10 days after being intimated about the same. In case the consumer opts to pay in lump-sum, an additional rebate of 5 per cent will be given. 
The second option is to pay in a maximum of six equal bi-monthly installments payable along with the next 6 bills.


(adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});

The other point that consumers should note is that the meter already installed in the premises would be replaced by Sub Divisional Officer (SDO) with a new electronic meter within three days. The cost of the meter would be charged from the consumer in case it is supplied by the Power Distribution Company or Nigam. 
While launching Bijli Bill Jurmana Maafi Yojana, the Chief Minister also assured that no checking would be carried out during the period of operation of the scheme (i.e. till December 31, 2016) for consumers having sanctioned load up to 5 KW. Also, no meter having similar load will be seized and sent to the lab for testing in this period. 
To make sure that more and more consumers can take benefit of Bijli Bill Jurmana Maafi Yojana, the Chief Minister has said that the consumers, whose meters have been seized for the verification in the M&T Lab and are pending for testing, will also have the option to avail this scheme. No further testing of the meter and investigation will be done in their case.
The cases of defective meters – including burnt meters, sticky, and dead stop – have also be covered under the scheme. In case any consumer feels that he or she has been treated fairly by the concerned Sub Divisional Officer, he or she can appeal to the concerned Executive Engineer. 
On receiving any such appeal, the concerned authority will have to decide the same within three working days. 
The consumers under the scheme can also avail Surcharge Waiver Scheme- 2016 if eligible for the same.

Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana – Gramin (PMAY-G) has finally been launched by the Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi in Agra on 20th November 2016. Under the PM Awas Yojana Gramin affordable housing scheme, central government aims to develop 3 Crore homes by the year 2022 in rural areas for poor families including BPL.
PMAY-G is the revamped version of Indira Awas Yojana which was renamed earlier this year with some pro-poor changes in the scheme. Housing units under the PMAY-G scheme are already being offered to the beneficiaries in rural areas across the country. Pradhan Mantri Narendra Modi also handed over the allotment letters to the beneficiaries during the launch event.
The minimum area of home under the new scheme has been increased to 25 Square meter (267 Square foot) from 20 Sq.Mt. in earlier scheme.
